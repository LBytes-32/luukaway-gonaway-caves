# The Shifting-Scrolling Demo's Change Log
### Notice
These records began later on in development. Not everything has been documented to the extend I would've preferred.

### Commit: Refactored Tile-Strips
- Added `createDivChild` function.
- Added `createDiv` function.
- Added `padding`, `strips`, and `tiles` to the `Map` class.
